"""
J.D. Power Customer Satisfaction extractor.

Source: https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/...
Auth:   None.
Method: HTML scraping with Playwright fallback.

Supplies: customer_satisfaction (J.D. Power Residential Electric
          Satisfaction Study, normalized to /100 from raw /1000)

CAVEAT — IMPORTANT FOR DATA COVERAGE:
  J.D. Power's free press releases only publish:
   - the industry-wide overall score
   - the top-ranked utility in each region (about 7-8 named utilities)
   - rank charts as IMAGE links (not text — can't be scraped from press release alone)

  So for any utility that isn't a #1 regional winner (PSE&G, Delmarva,
  MidAmerican, Omaha PPD, Georgia Power, EPB, SRP), this extractor will
  return null with a clear reason.  That's not a bug — it's a real
  limitation of J.D. Power's free disclosure.  Detailed individual
  utility scores require a paid J.D. Power subscription.

Confidence: 0.50.  Third-party survey, scraped from press release.
