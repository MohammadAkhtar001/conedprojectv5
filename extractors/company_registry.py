"""
Company registry.

Maps utility company names to the stable identifiers each government data
source uses.  Hand-curated rather than scraped — these IDs are stable and
the only correct way to address a company in each system.

CIK   = SEC Central Index Key (10 digit, used by data.sec.gov)
EIN   = IRS Employer Identification Number (used by ProPublica /nonprofits)
        Each utility's CORPORATE FOUNDATION has its own EIN distinct from
        the operating company.  The foundation EIN is what we want for 990
        philanthropy data.
EIA_OP_ID = EIA Operator ID from EIA Form 861/923 — used to attribute
            generation and reliability data.
EGRID_ORIS = EPA eGRID parent operator name — used to sum plant-level CO₂.

Adding a new utility: find the four IDs from public sources, add an entry.
This file is the single place company-specific knowledge lives.

Sources for IDs:
- CIK:        https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar (search by company name)
- EIN:        https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits (search by foundation name)
- EIA_OP_ID:  https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/ (download zip,

              published year's Excel file)
